This directory is intentionally blank for the SE Demo.  If there were policies in this directory they 
would be applied when deploying a demo env.  

Policies are generated in learn mode during a demo and then exported to this directory and 
applied with kubectl during a demo.

You would check the cluster resources menu under network policies to see the hardened kube policy
